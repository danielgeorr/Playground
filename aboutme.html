<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>In the 1970's, following the first moon landing, the future of the world was surely resting on flying cars and space travel. No one foresaw the rise and eventual takeover of the internet and digital media or how it would disrupt our lifestyle so massively and frequently.</p>

<p>The newspaper became an app on our phones therefore allowing millions of people to share the same bits of information, worldview and desires. As always, the quickest to react were brands, implementing themselves and their ambitions into this new world by investing in its innovation and adapting to it.</p>

<p>Some brands were created thanks to this digital revolution. Services like E-bay and Über reshaped entire industries. During that time, new forms of influence emerged. Online creators became opinion leaders and drove social movements that bring billions of people together as one. We're seeing real change in the world. Taboos are being lifted and power is getting younger.</p>

<p>
  
  Now What?

 <br/>

  Will we all go live in the meta-verse?
  
  <br/>

  Will the blockchain solve poverty?
  
  <br/>
  
  Will Big Brother find a way to control us all?
  
  <br/>
  
  Will we even get to decide?

</p>

<p>In my opinion, no we won’t. But as creatives, as strategists, as storytellers, what we can do is far more influential than that because our job isn’t to create the next scientific breakthrough. Our job is to make the most out of it. Like a poor kid playing with a stick, we can create engaging, fulfilling experiences. Then, by using research and data we can deliver them to the masses.</p>

<p>As more and more people acquire increasingly powerful gadgets. We have the opportunity to shape the way they adapt, use and perceive these new technologies. To influence social opinion, lift stigmas and most important of all to grant them a sense of inclusion in this digital landscape.</p>
